image_data=f"data:image/png;base64,{encoded_image}" 
some detail about data:image/png

The data:image/png;base64 format is part of the Data URI scheme, 
which allows embedding data directly within HTML or CSS without 
needing external files. This is often used for embedding images, 
fonts, or other binary data directly into web pages.

Detailed Breakdown of data:image/png;base64

.data:
Indicates that the content is a data URI rather than a traditional 
URL pointing to a file.

.image/png
Specifies the MIME type of the content.
In this case, image/png denotes the content is a PNG image.
Other MIME types include:
image/jpeg for JPEG images
image/gif for GIF images
text/html for HTML files, and more.

.base64
Indicates that the data is encoded in Base64 format.
Base64 encoding converts binary data into an ASCII string format, 
making it safe to include in text-based formats like HTML or JSON.

.{encoded_image}
Represents the actual Base64-encoded string of the binary image data.
This part contains the encoded representation of the image file.

Example
Here’s a simple example of a Data URI for a small red dot image:
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA
AAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4
//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL
0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Red Dot">

The src attribute directly embeds the image as Base64.
Browsers decode this and render the image as if it were an external resource.

Advantages of data:image/png;base64

.No External File Dependency:
Useful for embedding small images like icons in web pages without hosting them externally.
Inline Loading:
The browser doesn’t need to make an additional HTTP request to fetch the resource.

.Security:
Since the data is embedded in the document, it’s less prone to external tampering.

.Portability:
Entire assets (HTML + image) can be contained in a single file.

Disadvantages

.Larger File Size:
Base64 encoding increases the size of the original binary data by approximately 33%.

.Memory Usage:
The browser may use more memory when handling large Base64-encoded data URIs.

.Caching:
Unlike external files, Base64 data cannot be cached separately, meaning repeated use 
of the same image may increase overall page size.
